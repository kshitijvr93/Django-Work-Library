  <h2>Metadata Marshaling and Editing - Grant Proposal Idea Write-up</h2>
  Robert Phillips, September 29, 2017
<ul>
  </li><li> This grant is proposed to augment the UF Library Marshaling Website
        (MW system) with customizable metadata templates, which will support
        expansion of its metadata editing capabilities.
  </li><li>Background of the MW System
  <ul>
       <li>UF Library Marshaling Website, MW, is a component of, and it runs on, the UF Library's lib-marshal host RedHat machine.
       </li><li>MW employs <a
         href=" http://technologylicensing.research.ufl.edu/technologies/16508_user-configured-data-mining-and-conversion-software">
         UF proprietary xml2rdb technology</a>
         which is to be employed under this grant.
  </ul>
  </li><li>This grant will create new and combine current useful MW Capabilities to enable UFDC round-trip editing of current UFDC items.
  </li><ul>
  </li><li>Provide, and support additions to, a library of metadata format xml2rdb configurations (a type of template)  that can be revised or added to by beginning programmers or people versed with XML formats and metadata.
      <li>Provide a flexible web-based editing interface for UF Library staff and faculty to use a browser to create and edit item metadata, defined by the xml2rdb configurations.
      </li><li>Convert JSON data and other structured data to XML.
      </li><li>Convert XML data (including METS files) into standard SQL-relational database format to facilitate online edits.
      </li><li>Apply bulk updates easily to the database data for the items. For example, change the copyright statement for each item in a large group of items at once.
      </li><li>Provide the ability to convert the new or edited relational data for new or updated items back to an XML format.
      </li><li>Translate the XML data for each item into METS format, suitable to load to the UFDC/SobekCM  live website, or load some data directly into the UFDC database, or convert to JSON or other structured data formats.
    </ul>
  </li><li>Operation, upgrades, and maintenance of the MW system is independent of other UF Libraries software applications, and therefore revisions made to the xml2rdb configurations can immediately make available  the ability to edit and manage new forms of metadata.
  </li><li>Opportunity Cost: One 10-hr per week temporary beginning programmer employee E working for a duration of one year.
  </li><li> Employee (E) Duties:
  </li><ul>
     <li>E will receive training on how to describe xml2rdb configurations that link XML or structured data to a relational database.
     </li><li>E will create or revise existing configurations to add or revise xml elements in user-interfacing web-based editing forms.
     </li></ul>
  </li><li>Some Use Cases and Benefits:
     <ul>
<li>Augment current DPS capabilities to edit metadata more easily than using the UFDC/SobekCM interface, especially with bulk editing, and to more quickly implement new metadata schemes
</li><li>Increase facility to respond to external collaborations with UF Library metadata, for example for Deeply Rooted project, and to provide new OAI-PMH metadata fields
</li><li>Incorporate automatic retrievals of external API data to create or revise item metadata, for example
   <ul><li>to retrieve geographical coordinates automatically for items,
   </li><li> to retrieve or refresh data on the open-access attribute of items,
   </li><li> retrieve or refresh metadata that is accessible through crossref  APIs or other APIs
   </ul>
</li><li> Generation and management of metadata for internal projects, such as to manage annual IFAS Citations data and reporting.
</ul>
