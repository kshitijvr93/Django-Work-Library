<h4>Notes on the MAW Graph</h4>

<ol><li>
The orange boxes are the focus of the assessment of the efficacy of this grant.
Measures of success include:

<li></li>
The yellow box is the focus of the work by the OPS employee for this grant.
The TEAM will work together to prioritize new metadata mappings of use, for example, to import items from various OAI-PMH feeds, and to ensure that all MARC fields are being imported correctly and converted correctly to METS/MODS files or other output target formats.

<li></li>
The green boxes signify DPS processes and inputs that have already undergone
beta testing or have been used for production purposes, mostly based on previous
work with Elsevier and other DPS development projects.

<li><li>Metadata Map Configs:
These are mapping configurations that can be created and edited via the website interface.
They define how input data is to be mapped and converted to various types of required output formats.
(Marc or API sources to METS, how HathiTrust data prepared and converted for transmission to HathTrust)
Several mapping configurations are already in use that cover all the listed API sources.
A Marc configuration is been created to support the a Cuba collections.

<li></li>
Authors will receive emails when new Elsevier items of theirs are loaded into UFDC, including their
bib/vid ids.

<li></li>
The dashed line represents the ability to run the applications from the website manager users or
by schedules that are edited by manager users.
<li></li>
Availability of a website will allow running useful mapping, conversion and export programs
that have so far been run ad hoc solely by UFLIB-IT, so that they can be run at will by DPS
MAW website users.

<h4>MAW Grant - Measures of Success</h4>

<ol><li>
Whether DPS managers can excercise the feature of adding new metadata configurations.

</li><li>
Whether DPS staff can use the MAW to convert OAI-PMH API source data (or other data sources for which
exist metadata mapping configurations) to the prescripbed output formats, for example to produce UFDC-loadable METS files from the sources.

<h4>Opererational Notes</h4>

<ol><li>
On a special case by case basis, when small batches of updates with
manager-editable configurations is indicated, the MAW may be employed to
use METS files as input for batch editing. The edited files may be
submitted to the builder for their edits to be registered in UFDC.
for specialty batch edits is needed, and XIS
