<h2>I. Project proposal narrative</h2>
<ol type='a' >

<li><span style='text-decoration: underline'>
  Project description (goals, objectives, acivities)
</span></br>
<p>The Marshaling Applications Website (MAW) metadata editing project team
seeks $4,989 to augment
the UF Library Marshaling Applications Website with
customizable metadata templates, which will support and encourage expansion
of its metadata editing capabilities.
The Smathers Libraries' Marshaling Applications Website, MAW, is a
component of, and it runs on, the UF Library's lib-marshal host RedHat
machine.
MAW employs UF proprietary xml2rdb technology which will be the centerpiece
of this project.
</p><p>
The primary goal of the project is to create new and combine current useful
MAW Capabilities to enable UFDC round-trip editing for enhancing
discoverability of UFDC items.
The outcome of the project will be the provision and support of additions
to a library of metadata format xml2rdb configurations (a type of template)
that can be revised or added to by beginning programmers or people versed
with XML formats and metadata.
</p><p>
Upon completion, Libraries' staff and faculty will have access to a flexible
web-based editing interface to use a browser to create and edit item metadata,
defined by the xml2rdb configurations.
The interface will have the capacity to convert JSON data and other structured
data to XML, as well as converting XML data (including METS files) into
standard SQL-relational database format to facilitate online edits.
It will have the added capacity to apply bulk updates easily to the database
data for the items. For example, change the copyright statement for each item
in a large group of items at once; and provide the ability to convert the new
or edited relational data for new or updated items back to an XML format.
Finally, it will translate the XML data for each item into METS format,
suitable to load to the UFDC/SobekCM live website, or load some data directly
into the UFDC database, or convert to JSON or other structured data formats.
In terms of operation, upgrades, and maintenance of the MAW system, it is
independent of other software applications used in the Libraries; and
therefore revisions made to the xml2rdb configurations immediately can make
available the ability to edit and manage new forms of metadata.
</p>

</br>

</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline'>
  Project Importance
</span>
<!-- with edits from bess email 20171005t1725 her section title project importance -->
<p>
The use of MAW will provide a variety of benefits not currently available, especially for those working to create new metadata for large digital collections, including:
</p>
<ul><li>
Increased capacity to augment current DPS capabilities to edit metadata more easily than using the UFDC/SobekCM interface, especially with bulk editing, and to more quickly implement new metadata schemes;
</li><li>
Increased facility to respond to external collaborations with UF Library metadata, for example for Deeply Rooted project, and to provide new OAI-PMH metadata fields;
</li><li>
Generation and management of metadata for internal projects, such as to manage annual IFAS Citations data and reporting.
</li><li>
Incorporation of automatic retrievals of external API data to create or revise item metadata, for example to:
<ol><li>
retrieve geographical coordinates automatically for items,
</li><li>
retrieve or refresh data on the open-access attribute of items, or
</li><li>
retrieve or refresh metadata that is accessible through crossref APIs or other APIs
</li><ol>
</li></ul>

<p>
According to Digital Support Metadata Specialist, Angie Soto, "The
Marshalling tool would be of great benefit for retrospective clean up to
enhance metadata. Also, for bulky projects like Jerry Chicone Jr. Florida
Citrus Label Collection, which contains 3000+ items that would require me
to laboriously add subject headings, change local subject field tags (from
650 to 690), and add temporal coverage. The Marshalling tool would save me
two weeks of work (80 hours) on this project alone." (see Soto email of
support)
</p>

</br>

</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline'>
  Innovative Project Components
</span></br>
  <p>
  The metadata editor will be able to support bulk importing and editing and augmentation (add new metadata) of existing item metadata records, for projects like Deeply Rooted, where DPS was faced with the prospect of manual edits of over 3000 citrus labels. The edited data can be exported to SobekCM or other systems. The project is poised to evolve to supersede the SobekCM Mets Editor and similar "SmartTools"  and surpass some of their limitations, for example, specification of hundreds of authors.
</p><p>
  Further, in comparison to the current SobekCM/UFDC metadata editor, the Marshaling Applications Website (MAW) metadata editor will incorporate much of the look and feel of the UFDC/SobekCM form-based metadata editor, including these features:
  <ul><li>Form fields provide labels that are more descriptive than the typically shorter xml tags alone.
  </li><li>Fields with limited choices have drop-down lists to facilitate data entry.
  </li><li>Fields that are repeatable will also feature a 'Plus sign' button that allows the user to repeat the display field as many times as needed. A help button with help text is available for each field.
  </li><li>Groups of fields, or field sets, may be accessed separately (employing distinct window tabs or expand/collapse regions for each field set.)
  </li></ul>
</p><p>
Additionally, the MAW metadata editor further contrasts to the current UFDC/SobekCM metadata editor in the following ways:
<ol start="1"><li>
New or revised MAW metadata templates will be uploadable via the website by users with metadata template uploading permission.
</li><li>Uploaded metadata templates will automatically generate new metadata item editor interface forms that web users can select and use to edit metadata.
</li><li>MAW will provide a bulk change editor interface, and more user-specifiable metadata fields will be supported.
</li><li>Independent of UFDC/SobekCM, MAW operates its own internal UF Library website, so MAW updates will be more agile and easier to manage.
</li><li>MAW will directly output or transform edited metadata for download or transmission, for example, to HathiTrust.
</li><li>MAW will be able transform metadata to METS format and load it to the SobekCM/UFDC Builder at designated times, for example when the SobekCM builder is typically not bogged down with heavy traffic, to avoid slowdowns during the day.
</li></ol>
</p>

</br>
</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline'>
  Comparison to Similar Projects
</span></br>
    <p>Many other capable database and metadata editors exist, such as Oxygen,
  that run on standalone PCs, however since this metadata editor runs on the MAW hardware and software platform,  it will take advantage of:
  <ul><li>
  internal UF Library web access by users (so no need for independent installations
  and updates of software packages on staff PCs);
  </li><li>
  existing UF-proprietary
  xml2rdb technology with relational database functionality, and;
  </li><li>
  metadata editor users can use forms and so do not have to think like programmers.
  </li></ul>
</p><p>
  Other products exist that provide conversion between various XML data
  formats, such as XIS from AccessInnovations, as well.
  XIS requires its editorial interface to be installed on each user's PC, while the MAW
  metadata editor will only require a browser, and so it may be run by a UFDC user
  on any host, including Chrome OS, Linux, Windows, even mobile cell phones.
</p><p>
  The MAW metadata editor will also provide an interface for authorized UFDC users to
  upload and manage custom metadata template configurations that may be enhanced
  and created autonomously in real time by UF staff, and made available for use to enable editing of the new metadata formats.
  In addition the MAW Metadata editor provides access to SQL reports and
  commonly used SQL commands for batch editing of relational database representations of UFDC METS/XML data.
</p>

  Resources
  </span></br>
<p>
  One OPS employee with basic programming skills will be hired and trained
  on how to describe xml2rdb configurations that link XML or structured data
  to a relational database. The SOP funded employee  will create or revise
  existing configurations to add or revise xml elements in user-interfacing
  web-based editing forms. Other resources and expertise will be provided by..........
