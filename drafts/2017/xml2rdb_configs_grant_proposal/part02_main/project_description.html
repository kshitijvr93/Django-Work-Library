<p>The Metadata Marshaling and Editing project team seeks $5,000 to augment
the UF Library Marshaling Applications Website (MAW system) with
customizable metadata templates, which will support and encourage expansion
of its metadata editing capabilities.
The Smathers Libraries' Marshaling Applications Website (url), MAW, is a
component of, and it runs on, the UF Library's lib-marshal host RedHat
machine.
MAW employs UF proprietary xml2rdb technology which will be the centerpiece
of this project.
The primary goal of the project is to create new and combine current useful
MAW Capabilities to enable UFDC round-trip editing for enhancing
discoverability of UFDC items.
The outcome of the project will be the provision and support of additions
to a library of metadata format xml2rdb configurations (a type of template)
that can be revised or added to by beginning programmers or people versed
with XML formats and metadata.

Upon completion, Libraries' staff and faculty will have access to a flexible
web-based editing interface to use a browser to create and edit item metadata,
defined by the xml2rdb configurations.
The interface will have the capacity to convert JSON data and other structured
data to XML, as well as converting XML data (including METS files) into
standard SQL-relational database format to facilitate online edits.
It will have the added capacity to apply bulk updates easily to the database
data for the items. For example, change the copyright statement for each item
in a large group of items at once; and provide the ability to convert the new
or edited relational data for new or updated items back to an XML format.
Finally, it will translate the XML data for each item into METS format,
suitable to load to the UFDC/SobekCM live website, or load some data directly
into the UFDC database, or convert to JSON or other structured data formats.
In terms of operation, upgrades, and maintenance of the MAW system, it is
independent of other software applications used in the Libraries; and
therefore revisions made to the xml2rdb configurations immediately can make
available the ability to edit and manage new forms of metadata.
