The use of MAW will provide a variety of benefits not currently available,
especially for those working to create new metadata for large digital
collections, including:
</p>
<ul><li>
Increased capacity to augment current DPS capabilities to edit metadata
more easily than using the UFDC/SobekCM interface, especially with bulk
editing, and to more quickly implement new metadata schemes;
</li><li>
Increased facility to respond to external collaborations with UF Library
metadata, for example for Deeply Rooted project, and to provide new OAI-PMH
metadata fields;
</li><li>
Generation and management of metadata for internal projects, such as to
manage annual IFAS Citations data and reporting.
</li><li>
Incorporation of automatic retrievals of external API data to create or
revise item metadata, for example to:
<ol><li>
retrieve geographical coordinates automatically for items,
</li><li>
retrieve or refresh data on the open-access attribute of items, or
</li><li>
retrieve or refresh metadata that is accessible through crossref APIs or other APIs
</li><ol>
</li></ul>
<p> According to Laurie Taylor, "This would be of tremendous value for DPS
  in enabling them to meet current demands and expected future demands with
  ever more systems and transformations needed. This is a great project, and
  has my strong support!" (see Taylor email of support)
<p>
According to Digital Support Metadata Specialist, Angie Soto, "The
Marshalling tool would be of great benefit for retrospective clean up to
enhance metadata. Also, for bulky projects like Jerry Chicone Jr. Florida
Citrus Label Collection, which contains 3000+ items that would require me
to laboriously add subject headings, change local subject field tags (from
650 to 690), and add temporal coverage. The Marshalling tool would save me
two weeks of work (80 hours) on this project alone." (see Soto email of
support)

<p>Other letters of support from Laura Perry and Suzanne Stapleton
  state, other particular examples, that this project will significantly assist
  important dLoc and annual IFAS citation projects.
