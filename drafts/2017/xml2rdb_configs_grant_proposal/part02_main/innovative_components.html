  The MAW metadata editor provides options to import data from various data formats (Excel, XML, JSON) into relational database data, which in turn is the data format that the editor uses to enable the forms-based value editing feature. Forms are saved also to the relational data format. The user is given options to export the data to a variety of output formats, based on templates that are also managed by the MAW system.
