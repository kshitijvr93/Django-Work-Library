  The metadata editor will be able to support bulk importing and editing and augmentation (add new metadata) of existing item metadata records, for projects like Deeply Rooted, where DPS was faced with the prospect of manual edits of over 3000 citrus labels. The edited data can be exported to SobekCM or other systems. The project is poised to evolve to supersede the SobekCM Mets Editor and similar "SmartTools"  and surpass some of their limitations, for example, specification of hundreds of authors.

  Further, in comparison to the current SobekCM/UFDC metadata editor, the Marshaling Applications Website (MAW) metadata editor will incorporate much of the look and feel of the UFDC/SobekCM form-based metadata editor, including these features:
  <ul><li>Form fields provide labels that are more descriptive than the typically shorter xml tags alone.
  </li><li>Fields with limited choices have drop-down lists to facilitate data entry.
  </li><li>Fields that are repeatable will also feature a 'Plus sign' button that allows the user to repeat the display field as many times as needed. A help button with help text is available for each field.
  </li><li>Groups of fields, or field sets, may be accessed separately (employing distinct window tabs or expand/collapse regions for each field set.)
  </li></ul>

Additionally, the MAW metadata editor further contrasts to the current UFDC/SobekCM metadata editor in the following ways:
<ol start="1"><li>
New or revised MAW metadata templates will be uploadable via the website by users with metadata template uploading permission.
</li><li>Uploaded metadata templates will automatically generate new metadata item editor interface forms that web users can select and use to edit metadata.
</li><li>MAW will provide a bulk change editor interface, and more user-specifiable metadata fields will be supported.
</li><li>Independent of UFDC/SobekCM, MAW operates its own internal UF Library website, so MAW updates will be more agile and easier to manage.
</li><li>MAW will directly output or transform edited metadata for download or transmission, for example, to HathiTrust.
</li><li>MAW will be able transform metadata to METS format and load it to the SobekCM/UFDC Builder at designated times, for example when the SobekCM builder is typically not bogged down with heavy traffic, to avoid slowdowns during the day.
