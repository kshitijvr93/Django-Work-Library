<ul>
  <li>Compared to the SobekCM/UFDC metadata editor, the MAW metadata editor will
    incorporate much of the look and feel of the UFDC/SobekCM form-based
    metadata editor:
  <ul><li>
    Form fields provide labels that are more descriptive than the
    typically shorter xml tags alone.
  </li><li>
    Fields with limited choices have drop-down lists to facilitate data entry.
  </li><li>
    Fields that are repeatable will also feature a 'Plus sign' button that allows
    the user to repeat the display field as many times as needed.
  </li><li>
    A help button with help text is available for each field.
  </li><li>
    Groups of fields, or field sets, may be accessed separately (employing distinct
    window tabs or expand/collapse regions for each field set.)
  </li></ul>

</li><li>The MAW metadata editor contrasts to UFDC/SobekCM metadata editor:
    <ul><li> New or revised MAW metadata templates will be uploadable via the website by
    users with metadata template uploading permission.
  </li><li> Uploaded metadata templates will automatically
  generate new metadata item editor interface forms that web users can select
  and use to edit metadata.
</li><li> MAW will provide a bulk change editor interface, and more user-specifiable
  metadata fields will be supported.
</li><li> Independent of UFDC/SobekCM, MAW operates its own
    internal UF Library website, so MAW updates will be more agile and easier to manage.
  </li><li>
    MAW will directly output or transform edited metadata for download or
    transmission, for example, to HathiTrust.
  </li><li>
    MAW will be able transform metadata to METS format and load it to the SobekCM/UFDC
    Builder at designated times, for example when the SobekCM
    builder is typically not bogged down with heavy traffic, to avoid slowdowns
    during the day.
  </li></ul>
</li><li>Many other capable database and metadata editors exist, such as Oxygen,
  that run on standalone PCs, however since this metadata editor runs on the MAW hardware and software platform,  it will take advantage of:
  <ul><li>
   internal UF Library web access by users (so no need for independent installations and updates of software packages on staff PCs)
 </li><li>
   existing UF-proprietary
  xml2rdb technology with relational database functionality
 </li><li>
 metadata editor users can use forms and so do not have to think like programmers, and
 </li><li>
  Easy integration with xml2rdb technology and the MAW platform, which already has coding to prepare metadata METS loads into UFDC, based on prior work.
  </li></ul>
