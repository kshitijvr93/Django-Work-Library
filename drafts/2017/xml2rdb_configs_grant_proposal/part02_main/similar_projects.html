<p>Many other capable database and metadata editors exist, such as Oxygen,
  that run on standalone PCs, however since this metadata editor runs on the MAW hardware and software platform,  it will take advantage of:
  <ul><li>
  internal UF Library web access by users (so no need for independent installations
  and updates of software packages on staff PCs);
  </li><li>
  existing UF-proprietary
  xml2rdb technology with relational database functionality, and;
  </li><li>
  metadata editor users can use forms and so do not have to think like programmers.
  </li></ul>
