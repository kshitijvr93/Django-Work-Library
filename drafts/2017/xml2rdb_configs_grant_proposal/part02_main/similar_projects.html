<ul>
  <li>UFDC/SobekCM: this project's web-based item editor will incorporate
  much of the look and feel of the SobekCM form-based editor, yet will run
  on MAW. MAW will also provide bulk-editing of tags across multiple items. The advantages of this project include:
  <ul><li>A metadata template editor will also be available that allows
    immediate changes or additions to metadata templates that will automatically enable new editors for new templates of metadata.
