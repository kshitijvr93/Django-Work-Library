<ul>
  <li>UFDC/SobekCM: in comparison, this project's web-based item editor will
    incorporate much of the look and feel of the UFDC/SobekCM form-based
    metadata editor:
  <ul><li>
    Form fields provide labels that are more descriptive than the
    typically shorter xml tags alone.
  </li><li>
    Forms with limited choices have drop-down lists to facilitate data entry.
  </li><li>
    Fields that are repeatable will feature a 'Plus sign' button that allows
    the user to repeat the display field as many (or as few) times as needed.
  </li><li>
    A help button with help text is available for each field.
  </li><li>
    Groups of fields, or fieldsets, may be accessed separately (employing
    window tabs or expand/collapse regions for each independent field set.)
  </li></ul>

</li><li>The MAW item metadata editor contrasts to UFDC/SobekCM item metadata editor:
    <ul><li> New or revised MAW metadata templates will be uploadable via the website by
    users with template uploading permission.
  </li></li> Uploaded metadata templates will automatically
  generate new metadata item editor interface forms that web users can select and use to edit item metadata.
  </li><li> Bulk changes to user-specifiable item metadata fields will be supported.
  </li><li> Because MAW is independent of UFDC/SobekCM, operating on its own
    internal UF Library staff accessible open source website, MAW updates will be more agile
    and easier to create.
  </li></ul>
    Edited item metadata can be output directly by MAW to downloadable files for sharing with
    colleagues and exporting of data, for example to HathiTrust.
  </li><li>
    Item metadata can transformed to METS format and be scheduled for upload to the SobekCM Builder when edited or done later at a time when the SobekCM builder is typically not bogged down with heavy traffic, to avoid slow downs during the day.
  </li></ul>
