<p>Many other capable database and metadata editors exist, such as Oxygen,
  that run on standalone PCs, however since this metadata editor runs on the MAW hardware and software platform,  it will take advantage of:
  <ul><li>
  internal UF Library web access by users (so no need for independent installations
  and updates of software packages on staff PCs);
  </li><li>
  existing UF-proprietary
  xml2rdb technology with relational database functionality, and;
  </li><li>
  metadata editor users can use forms and so do not have to think like programmers.
  </li></ul>
</p><p>
  Other products exist that provide conversion between various XML data
  formats, such as XIS from AccessInnovations, as well.
  XIS requires its editorial interface to be installed on each user's PC, while the MAW
  metadata editor will only require a browser, and so it may be run by a UFDC user
  on any host, including Chrome OS, Linux, Windows, even mobile cell phones.
</p><p>
  The MAW metadata editor will also provide an interface for authorized UFDC users to
  upload and manage custom metadata template configurations that may be enhanced
  and created autonomously in real time by UF staff, and made available for use to enable editing of the new metadata formats.
  In addition the MAW Metadata editor provides access to SQL reports and
  commonly used SQL commands for batch editing of relational database representations of UFDC METS/XML data.
