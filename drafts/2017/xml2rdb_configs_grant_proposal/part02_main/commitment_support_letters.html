Hi Robert,

Thanks so much for answering on my questions. I can definitely see the value of this. While I am not a production user, I am a collection creator and user, and collections and items change over time as new items are added, collections grow and change. DPS criticallly needs the ability to bulk update metadata, and to transform metadata to send to other repositories and systems. As a user and collaborator with different projects and systems, there are many and increasing needs for editing and transforming metadata at scale, with this need only expected to increase as UFDC continues to grow with many millions of pages to come.

This would be of tremendous value for DPS in enabling them to meet current demands and expected future demands with ever more systems and transformations needed. This is a great project, and has my strong support!

Best wishes,
Laurie
