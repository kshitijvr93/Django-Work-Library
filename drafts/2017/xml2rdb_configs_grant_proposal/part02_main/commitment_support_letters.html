Hi Robert,

Thanks so much for answering on my questions. I can definitely see the value of this. While I am not a production user, I am a collection creator and user, and collections and items change over time as new items are added, collections grow and change. DPS criticallly needs the ability to bulk update metadata, and to transform metadata to send to other repositories and systems. As a user and collaborator with different projects and systems, there are many and increasing needs for editing and transforming metadata at scale, with this need only expected to increase as UFDC continues to grow with many millions of pages to come.

This would be of tremendous value for DPS in enabling them to meet current demands and expected future demands with ever more systems and transformations needed. This is a great project, and has my strong support!

Best wishes,
Laurie

  I create and enhance metadata for the University of Florida Digital Collections. The Marshalling tool would be of great benefit for retrospective clean up to enhance metadata. Also, for bulky projects like Jerry Chicone Jr. Florida Citrus Label Collection, which contains 3000+ items that would require me to laboriously add subject headings, change local subject field tags (from 650 to 690), and add temporal coverage. The Marshalling tool would save me two weeks of work (80 hours) on this project alone. There’s also another bulky project I’ve been putting off because of its magnitude. For Geological Publications, I would have to add series titles, change the titles to include the number of Geological publication, add subject headings, and make sure aggregations are consistent.

Dear Grants Management Committee,
Please accept this as a letter of commitment for Robert’s Metadata Marshaling and Editing Project. The concept of a marshalling tool would be of extreme benefit to the Digital Production Services (DPS) department, as we currently spend numerous hours each week enhancing metadata. Without tools and programs such as the marshalling tool, DPS staff and OPS employees are required to edit each record individually. With over 540,000 items in the UF Digital Collections (UFDC), this tool would allow staff to enhance and update metadata in bulk, which would allow them to dedicate more of their time to other projects.

As the technical hosts of the Digital Library of the Caribbean, DPS staff also ingest and enhance digital records from dLOC partners. In recent months, we have received numerous requests from dLOC partners to harvest their records via OAI feed. Since we are currently unable to bulk overlay metadata, we do not have a viable method for ingesting their enhanced records. Since marshalling tool would assist with this processes, we will be able to provide greater service to our dLOC partners.
Thank you,
Laura Perry
Manager, Digital Production Services

Subject: Re: Metadata Marshaling and Editing Project and Feedback

Hi Robert,

I’m writing in support of your Strategic Opportunities Grant to improve UF Libraries capabilities to batch edit metadata of digital items through development of MAW.  Discoverability of digital resources is highly dependent on effectively structured metadata. Early efforts to populate the UFDC, for instance, were focused on the quantity of additions, at times at the expense of descriptive metadata.  Recognition of the importance and standards of metadata continue to evolve.  As Marjorie Hlaviv, president of Access Innovations, said during training offered at UF Libraries, we should expect to change metadata as interests, language and knowledge change.  Thus, an efficient mechanism to enable editing multiple digital records would be of great benefit.

As you describe Robert, this project has the potential to improve the annual IFAS citation report that I manage on behalf of the libraries.   You have been developing code to improve the efficiency of reviewing the quality of these citations as a pilot project with me this year.  I can imagine significant time-savings of revising the metadata in these citations in batches using your software.   It is not uncommon for the required format of the report to change from year to year.  The marshaling and editing software you develop would enable efficient replacement, for example, of journal name abbreviations with full journal titles, a new requirement for this report this year.  I expect there are many additional beneficial applications for the MAW.  For instance, I have witnessed the need to edit batch imports of digital scholarly journal archives into Florida Online Journals.

I support your project to develop and test a system to enable efficient editing of digital record metadata.  I expect this work to result in labor-saving benefits in many different applications.
 
Best,
Suzanne
