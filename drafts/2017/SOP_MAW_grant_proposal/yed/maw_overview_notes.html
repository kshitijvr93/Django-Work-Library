<h4>Notes on Figure 1. Graph of MAW</h4>
<ol><li>
The yellow box "Metadata map Configs" is the focus of the work by the OPS employee for this grant.
<p>
Mapping configurations define how input data is to be mapped and converted to various types of required output formats.
<p>
Several mapping configurations are already in use that cover all the listed API sources.
Both an OAI-PMH and a Marc mapping configuration have already been created to support Cuba collections.
<p>
In this project we will
create new mappings to assist with batch edits and imports of customized OAI-PMH data.
The TEAM will work together to prioritize new metadata mappings of use, for
example, to import items from various OAI-PMH feeds, and to design mappings for
all input source fields for each custom OAI-PMH feed to be converted correctly to
METS/MODS files or other output target formats.

The orange boxes highlight the areas of the grant project work that are the focus of the assessment
of the efficacy of this grant. A separate list of measures of success of this grant appear below.

</li><li>
The green boxes signify DPS processes and inputs that have already
undergone beta testing or have been used for production purposes.
These are mostly products of previous work with Elsevier and other DPS development projects.

</li><li>
DPS managers will interact with the Marshaling Applications Website (MAW) to approve, create
and update Metadata Map Configurations. The OPS Employee may also use the website or use a simple
text editor or xml editor to edit the map configurations.
</li><li>
DPS non-management staff will not have permissions to edit the configurations.
However, they will use the website to (1) upload source files, (2) optionally define some edits to apply (for edits of batches of METS files),  (3) ingest source data from OAI-PMH feeds,
and (4) to run the marshaling mapping application to create the output data.
The MAW can automatically copy that output to designated output areas
(for example, the UFDC inbound folder), or the user can download it to their local PC.
</li><li>
Authors will receive emails when new Elsevier items of theirs are loaded into UFDC, including their
bib/vid ids.
</li><li>
The dashed line represents the ability to run the applications by the website manager users or
by schedules that are edited by manager users.
</li><li>
Library Staff can also be sent reports in emails on the number of new items mapped by the MAW on a periodic basis.
</li><li>
Availability of a website will allow running useful mapping, conversion and export programs
that have so far been run ad hoc solely by UFLIB-IT, so that they can be run at will by DPS
MAW website users.

<h4>MAW Grant - Measures of Success</h4>
The orange boxes are the focus of the assessment of the efficacy of this grant.
Measures of success or efficacy include:
<ol><li>
Whether DPS managers can excercise the feature of adding new metadata configurations.
</li><li>
Whether DPS staff can use the MAW to convert OAI-PMH API source data
to the prescripbed output formats, including to produce UFDC-loadable METS files from the sources.
</li><li>
Whether DPS staff can use the MAW to convert MARC source data
to the prescripbed output formats, including to produce UFDC-loadable METS files from the sources.
</li><li>
Whether DPS managers can modify the mapping of OAI-PMH API source data to put fields in different
METS/MODS fields.
</li><li>
Whether DPS staff can create valid HathiTrust packages using the MAW.
</li><li>
Whether DPS staff can effect limited surgical edits to a batch of METS files, for example to
change the copyright statement or one of a few other targetted fields, for a batch of METS records.
</li><li>
This is a relatively new measure of success, but with the advent of the XIS
system, the MAW may be of use in assisting creation of XIS-compliant XML collection descriptions.
A measure of success is whether the MAW can create a valid XIS collection format description
for use by XIS.
</li><li>
Whether UF authors of Elsevier (maybe all IR articles as well) receive emails when their article is first submitted for loading into UFDC.
