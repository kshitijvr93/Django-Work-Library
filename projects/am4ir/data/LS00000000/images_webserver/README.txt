This directory holds images used by the AM4IR project/feature, also known
as the Elsevier Phase II Pilot project (active in years 2016-2018)

This directory and its contents are meant to be copied to and stored under
the 'Resources' directory under F:\ufdc\resources\LS\00\00\00\00\am4ir,
where F: is my personal windows drive letter for the production filesystem
in use today 20180712 by the UFDC SobekCM system.

The image files under am4ir are named particularly for use by the SobekCM
code that runs the am4ir feature.

Subdirectories are ignored by SobekCM, but store various image candidates
beheld and considered by AM4IR project members at various times.
The ones that are preferred for presentation for UFDC patrons should be
copied up in the this am4ir directory with the given names, and so they
will appear on the associated SobekCM displays.

This way, future changes to images may be made in real time by simply copying
the images desired into the am4ir directory with the given file names.
