'''
Read an am4ir spreadsheet, as Letitia Mukherjee sent me in
in 2017 and insert it into a db table.
I did this in a spreadsheet_to_table.py test case, in my
modules/sqlalchemy_tools/core subfolder, but the code should
really live here in this folder.

TODO:Copy/adapt that code to use here the next time I need to run
it.
