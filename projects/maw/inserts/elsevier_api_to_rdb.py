Program elsevier_api_to_rdb.py

Now, xml2rdb can be and is used to translate uf elsevier
harvestd MD info to MAW or other db tables, due to
2018 January improvements to xml2rdb to also do bulk inserts
for mysql and postgresql.

NOTE: Since xml2rdb is still simple to launch/run by hand,
there is no simple utility (yet) embodied in the MAW project
to launch this particular converson/insertion option.

But this seems a good filename to host that code when it is written.
