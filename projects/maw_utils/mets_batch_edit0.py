# In a sequence of files, do a simple python replace
# fileinput and ouput
# Initial application: change all lines like:
# <mods:mods>
# to a stanza:
# <mods:mods>
# <abstract>
# some standard abstract text
# </abstract>
# This is similar to some oyster import code, so copy pasting from there to start.
# 
# root_path = "F:"
