# Required - the date and approximate time the volume was scanned. This date
# will be used for the PREMIS capture event. It will also be used to populate
# the ModifyDate TIFF header and XMP tiff:DateTime image headers if they are
# missing in the submitted images.
#
# This must be in the ISO8601 combined date format with time zone
# (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations)
#
# Note: the -05:00 is a representation of a time zone offset from UTC, not
# a representation of a time range.
capture_date: 2013-11-01T12:31:00-05:00

# If the submitted images are missing information about the scanner make and
# model (XMP tiff:Make and tiff:Model header) it can be supplied here. It will
# only be used if the submitted images do not have the scanner make.  This
# element is optional.
scanner_make: CopiBook
scanner_model: HD

# If the submitted images do not have the TIFF Artist or XMP tiff:Artist
# header, this value must be supplied. It should reflect "who pushed the
# button" to actually scan the item. This could be an organizational unit or an
# outside vendor. It will only be used if the submitted images are missing the
# TIFF Artist and XMP tiff:Artist headers.

# Required: date the digital file this submission was created from was created.
# For example, suppose a university press provides a born-digital PDF file for ingest
# into HathiTrust. Record the creation date of that PDF here.
creation_date: 2013-10-01T12:23:42-05:00

# Required: HathiTrust organization code of who created the digital file. This is
# typically the organization-specific part of the domain name. If the organization code
# is unknown, contact HathiTrust staff.
creation_agent: knowledgeunlatched

# Optional: If there is a "content provider" of the digital item that differs per
# item in the submission batch, record the HathiTrust organization code here. For
# example, if several different publishers provided digital files to Michigan that were
# prepared for ingest into HathiTrust, the publisher would be recorded here. Most of
# the time, this will be the same as the creation agent.
digital_content_provider: dukeupress

# If the submitted images do not have the TIFF Artist or XMP tiff:Artist header, this
# value must be supplied. It should reflect who created the original born digital item.
# Frequently this will be the author or publisher of the item. It will only be used if
# the submitted images are missing the TIFF Artist and XMP tiff:Artist headers.

# Resolution for contone TIFFs or JPEG2000 images

# If the images were compressed, converted, or normalized before SIP

# If this volume was scanned right-to-left and/or should read right-to-left,
# put "right-to-left" for the scanning or reading order here. If this information
# is not provided, volumes are assumed to be scanned left-to-right and read
# left-to-right. For born digital material, "scanning order" really means
# "rasterization order".

# The possibilities are:
#
# Book reads left-to-right and 00000001.tif is the FRONT cover of the book:
#   scanning_order: left_to_right; reading_order: left_to_right
# Book reads left-to-right but 00000001.tif is the BACK cover of the book:
#   scanning_order: right_to_left; reading_order: left_to_right
# Book reads right-to-left and 00000001.tif is the FRONT cover of the book:
#   scanning_order: right_to_left; reading_order: right_to_left
# Book reads right-to-left but 00000001.tif is the BACK cover of the book:
#   scanning_order: left_to_right; reading_order: right_to_left
#
# For more complicated cases (e.g. books that are half in English and half in Hebrew and # are read either left to right or right to left, or books that are in two left-to-right # languages and one language is printed upside-down from the other), pick the correct
# scanning order and one of the correct reading orders. Users of the other language can
# use the interface to adjust the view appropriately.
scanning_order: left-to-right
reading_order: left-to-right

# Optionally, page numbers and page tag data can be supplied here.
# The orderlabel is the page number and the label is the page tag.
# Multiple page tags should be comma-separated.
#
# Allowable page tags include:
#
# BACK_COVER - Image of the back cover
#
# BLANK - An intentionally blank page.
#
# CHAPTER_PAGE - A sort of half title page for a chapter of grouping of
# chapters -- that is, a page that gives the name of the chapter or section
# that begins on the next page.
#
# CHAPTER_START - Subsequent chapters with regular page numbering after the
# first. Also use this for the beginning of each appendix.
#
# COPYRIGHT - Title page verso (the back of the real title page)
#
# FIRST_CONTENT_CHAPTER_START - First page of the first chapter with regular
# page numbering. If the first chapter with regular numbering is called the
# introduction, that's okay.
#
# FOLDOUT - A page that folded out of the print original
#
# FRONT_COVER - Image of the front cover (if the cover of the book was scanned)
#
# IMAGE_ON_PAGE - Use for plates (pages with only images, which often do not
# contain the regular page numbering)
#
# INDEX - The first page in a sequence containing an index
#
# MULTIWORK_BOUNDARY: for items with multiple volumes bound together
#
# PREFACE - First page of each section that appears between the title page
# verso and the first regularly numbered page. For example, a one-page
# dedication on page xvi would get this tag, and then the first page of a
# three-page preface starting on page xviii would also get this.  However, if
# the introduction of the text starts on page 1 (or on an unnumbered page
# followed by page 2), do not use this tag. Use for components occurring before
# and after the table of contents.
#
# REFERENCES - The first page in a sequence containing endnotes or a
# bibliography
#
# TABLE_OF_CONTENTS - First page of the table of contents
#
# TITLE - Title page recto (the front of the real title page)
#
# TITLE_PARTS - Half title page (a sort of preliminary title page before the
# real one)
#
# Please contact HathiTrust staff for additional guidance in mapping your page tags
# to HathiTrust conventions.
#
# Note: the indentation here must use only spaces, never tabs: see
