$ ssh -l rvp a45.33.20.64

However, I have to set things up for the web server to run ok...
I think it may be related to the need for a new SSL certificate because the static ip has changed.


on linode, restart apache2?
#

httpd not running, trying to start
root@lawcloud9:/var/log/apache2# sudo service apache2 restart
